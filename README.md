# SevenStories

Text-adventure game in very early stages of development.

The latest release, **v0.1a1**, supports the following:

* Saving/loading/deleting/resetting characters in a main menu interface.
* A game loop to follow once a character has been loaded.  Each loop asks the user to enter a command.  The loop can be stopped by using the "quit" action.
* Four usable actions: name, health, save, quit
* A reminder to save in the event that a user tries to quit and the previous action was not "save".
